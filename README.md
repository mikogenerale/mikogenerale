## ✨About Me ✨

Experienced Software Engineer with a proven track record of delivering high-quality applications. I have developed numerous projects across web, mobile, and server-side platforms. During my corporate journey, I’ve contributed to three major projects — two client-based and one internal — playing a key role in their successful delivery.

Additionally, I have some experience developing desktop applications, including a custom Pisonet Management System that I currently use for my small business.
