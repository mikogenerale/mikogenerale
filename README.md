## ✨About Me ✨

Experienced Software Engineer with a proven track record of delivering high-quality applications. I have developed numerous projects across web, mobile, and server-side platforms. During my corporate journey, I’ve contributed to three major projects — two client-based and one internal — playing a key role in their successful delivery.

Additionally, I have some experience developing desktop applications, including a custom Pisonet Management System that I currently use for my small business.

I'm a passionate developer dedicated to building clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications. I thrive on solving real-world problems through technology and continuously seek opportunities to learn, improve, and stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
